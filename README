KDing

KDing is a KDE port of Ding, a dictionary lookup program. It sits in
KDE's system tray and can translate the current clipboard content. Users can
also enter single words or phrases for translation. It is intended to be used
for translating between German and English, but can be used with every
language for which a word list is available for Ding.

This program is released under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2.
See the file COPYING for details.
