Maintenance:
* replace or remove deprecated KF5 interfaces:
  KStartupInfo::startupId(), KWindowSystem::windowRemoved(WId)
* port to Qt6/KF6
* replace stuff deprecated in Qt6

Bugs:
* "Remember window position" still doesn't work correctly on X11
  (on wayland, window placement isn't possible anyway)

Features:
* improve keyboard handling (scrolling results)
* better html template engine with named substitutions (simple map or
  grantlee/ktexttemplate)
* integrate abbreviations (as tooltips and/or show all)
* allow selecting different dictionaries
* add other search engines (spell checker, thesaurus, dict, fortune, wtf,
  search in message catalogs, word lists, ...)
* optionally use builtin regex engine as search backend
* limit # of results shown (configurable)
* improve speed and memory usage when showing large result lists

Dictionaries:
* include more dictionaries?
* ding website links to a small de-es dictionary and scripts to convert
  wiktionary data into ding dictionaries
* the other dictionaries that powered Beolingus (de-es and de-pt) seem
  not to be available under a free license;
  see also <https://github.com/haukex/de-en-dict/issues/6>
* other sources?
* separate code and dictionaries? (different branches? separate archives
  for releases only?)
