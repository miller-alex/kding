Description: KDE port of Ding
 KDing is a KDE port of Ding, a dictionary lookup program. It sits in
 KDE's system tray and can translate the current clipboard content. Users can
 also enter single words or phrases for translation. It is intended to be used
 for translating between German and English, but can be used with every
 language for which a word list is available for Ding.
